 * Description: This file contains the program to demonstrate the LED Fading depending on PWM duty Cycle. 

This code has been developed and tested on ExploreEmbedded boards.  
We strongly believe that the library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. 
Check this link http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki for awesome tutorials on 8051,PIC,AVR,ARM,Robotics,RTOS,IOT.
ExploreEmbedded invests substantial time and effort developing open source HW and SW tools, to support consider buying the ExploreEmbedded boards.
