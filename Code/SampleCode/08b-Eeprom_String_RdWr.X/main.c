 * File:   main.c
 * Version: 16.0
 * Author: ExploreEmbedded
 * Website: http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki
 * Description: This file contains the program to write a string at memory location 0x00 and read it back.
 *              The string read and written is transmitted on UART.  

This code has been developed and tested on ExploreEmbedded boards.  
We strongly believe that the library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. 
Check this link http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki for awesome tutorials on 8051,PIC,AVR,ARM,Robotics,RTOS,IOT.
ExploreEmbedded invests substantial time and effort developing open source HW and SW tools, to support consider buying the ExploreEmbedded boards.
